RSI-CB: A Large Scale Remote Sensing Image Classification Benchmark via Crowdsource Data
====
We propose a scalable remote sensing benchmark based on crowd source data, which can automatically label the remote sensing image through the public source data at hand.On the basis of this method, we construct a global scale large-scale remote sensing image classification database.  There are seven kinds of land for land use, `cultivated land`,` construction land`, `transportation`,` water area`, `woodland`, `other land `and `other objects`, where each category has several subclasses. Considering the different depth of the convolution network for the image size requirements, we built a` 256 * 256` and `128 * 128` size of the two data sets, the former contains `35 categories` of objects, a total of more than `24,000 images`, the later contains `45 categories`,a total of more than `36,000 images`. 
 
Finally, We analyzed the image classification accuracy of several classical depth learning models such as AlexNet, VGGNet, GoogleNet and ResNet in RSI-CB, SAT-4, SAT-6 and UC-Merced image libraries. Experiments show that RSICD is more suitable as The model of the remote sensing image classification task of the large data age and the model trained by the RSI-CB data has a good generalization ability and can be used in practical applications.

According to the global distribution of OSM, we selected the cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and other cities in the United States, New York and Washington, and other cities in the United States, London and Liverpool, and so on. According to the global distribution of OSM data and satellite remote sensing image data, Germany and other cities such as Berlin, Cologne and other cities; cities such as Tokyo, Japan, cities such as Paris, France, cities such as Ottawa, Toronto, Russia and other cities in Brazil, Rio de Janeiro and other countries and their regions
