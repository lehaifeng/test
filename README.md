RSI-CB: A Large Scale Remote Sensing Image Classification Benchmark via Crowdsource Data
====
We propose a scalable remote sensing benchmark based on crowd source data, which can automatically label the remote sensing image through the public source data at hand, and lay the theoretical foundation for constructing the large-scale remote sensing image recognition task base. On the basis of this method, we construct a global scale large-scale remote sensing image classification database. We have established a strict classification system of terrain classification according to the national standard of land use classification in China and the stratification mechanism of ImageNet. There are seven kinds of land for land use, agricultural land, construction land, transportation, water and water conservancy facilities, grassland, woodland and other land Category, where each category has several subclasses. Considering the different depth of the convolution network for the image size requirements, we built a 256 * 256 and 128 * 128 size of the two data sets, the former contains 35 categories of objects, a total of more than 24,000 pieces of video blocks, which contains 45 A total of more than 36,000 pieces of impact. Finally, this paper analyzes the image classification accuracy of several classical depth learning models such as AlexNet, VGGNet, GoogleNet and ResNet in RSI-CB, SAT-4, SAT-6 and UC-Merced image libraries. Experiments show that RSICD is more suitable as The model of the remote sensing image classification task of the large data age and the model trained by the RSI-CB data has a good generalization ability and can be used in practical applications.
